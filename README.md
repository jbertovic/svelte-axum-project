# New Version 0.4.0
  - updated to `axum` 0.6
  - changes to State usage; how its setup with route and called from middleware

  - eliminated `axum::extract::RequestParts` with help from update on `axum-sessions`
- updated to `axum-sessions` 0.4 to match
- incremented `tokio` version to 1.24

# Help
- If anyone has ideas of how to implement a build file that would handle the npm script build on the front end and the rust cargo run together, let me know.

# Template
## Using Cargo
- Must have cargo generate installed: `cargo install cargo-generate`
- Then use `cargo generate jbertovic/svelte-axum-project -n <your-project-name>`

## Using git template
- you can also just hit the "use this template" button in green on top of the repo
- if you have gh cli installed check out `--template` option

# Back end - Rust Axum
- located in `./back_end`
- serves front end directory
- middleware for checking authorization header
- middleware for checking session that user exists
- store example that holds token secret for authorization
- /api route example using authorization header
- /secure route example using sessions for authorization

Note there is no persistance beyond what's held in memory while the application is running

run as `cargo run` from parent directory and not needed to run inside `./back_end` folder

# Front end - Svelte
- Located in `./front_end`
- navbar with login and logout
- secure page that shows session information once logged in
- api fetch example, log in not required

run as `npm run build` from inside the `./front_end` directory to build the static serve file directory.
